# Blockchain-Interoperability
What is Blockchain Interoperability?
In its simplest terms, blockchain interoperability allows different blockchain protocols to actively communicate with each other. Therefore, different chains can interact and share data, which results in making it easier to use different blockchain networks. A common analogy is that of emails. We send emails everyday, and one of the most essential functions of all email systems is that someone with a Gmail account can send emails to someone with a Yahoo or Info account.
 
In its current state, there are no layer one blockchain protocols that can do this.
 
While you are working with an application on the Ethereum network, as an example, you cannot make a direct payment to a separate chain like Cosmos. Blockchain interoperability would mean that any blockchain layers could transact or send messages to an outside chain.
 
The ability to cross blockchain networks in this way is still largely theoretical but many projects have made great strides in their studies to find a solution to interoperability.
